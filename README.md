The code's purpose is to create two clocks in C++ that display simultaneously on a website. 
One clock shows the time in a 12-hour format (AM/PM), while the other displays the time in a 24-hour format (international standard ISO 8601). 
Users can interact with these clocks, providing input securely and efficiently through the application's interface.
